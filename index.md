# Research Interests  
I am a self-motivated and team-minded master student with 2 years of experience in studying the 
numerical methods of solving the electromagnetic problems (especially the integral equation method). 
I am interested in applying different mathematical and physical theories and methods to solve the 
electromagnetic problems appearing in the microwave technology.
