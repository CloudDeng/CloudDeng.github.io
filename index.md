# Research Interests  
I am a self-motivated and team-minded master student with 2 years of experience in studying the 
numerical methods of solving the electromagnetic problems. I am interested in applying different 
mathematical and physical theories and methods to solve the electromagnetic problems appearing in 
the microwave technology.
